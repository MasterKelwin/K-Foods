## About  

Im a front-end developer studying React, made this app to learn Styled Components and test my skills on react.  

We have a dinamic pizza menu, the user can search, filter or order the flavors.  

### Functionalities  

1- Render components passing props around all the application without using global scope.  
2- Interfaces and Types used in this application.  
3- useState for save an array of objects and render in DOM (keys used with ID).  
4- useEffect to watch few states and change the pizzas rendered.  
5- Responsive on all devices, even after deploy.  
6- Leaving few responsabilities as possible in the components, except in the main app because I choose to not use global scope.  
7- Some simples animations for make the app more cool.  


### Dependencies  

1-Typescript  
2-Styled Components
